# Environment Enhancement Script

Script to deal with environment enhancement

## How to use

Create a map and get difficulty file, put the script in the same place as the
map file, edit the script accordingly, run the script, done.

Alternatively, copy the `_environment` inside `environment.dat` and place it
into `_customData`.

If you've made lightshow for platform prior to environment enhancement, consider
using `lightConvert.js` and adjust the settings accordingly.
